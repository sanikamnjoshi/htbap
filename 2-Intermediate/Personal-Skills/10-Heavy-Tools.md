# Heavy Tools
 [//]: # (Version:1.0.0)
As our technological culture progresses, software technology moves from inconceivable, to research, to new products, to standardized products, to widely available and inexpensive products. ==These heavy tools can pull great loads, but can be intimidating and require a large investment in understanding. The intermediate programmer has to know how to manage them and when they should be used or considered.==

==To my mind right now some of the best heavy tools are ðŸ’¿==:

- Relational Databases,
- Full-text Search Engines,
- Math libraries,
- OpenGL,
- XML parsers, and
- Spreadsheets.
